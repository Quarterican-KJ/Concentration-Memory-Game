# Memory Game Project

## About the Game

This is my take on the project memory game "Concentration" for the Udacity Front End Web Developer course.

## How to install.

Use GitHub's "Clone or Download" option to get copy of this game Concentration â€” from there, you can clone the files to your own GitHub repo, download the files to your computer, or use a command shell tool with the provided "Clone or Download" URL. Simply open up the index.html file and enjoy!

## How to Play.

Pick a card to start playing.
Match two cards to progress.
Rinse Repeat
PROFIT!

## Dependencies

This game uses javaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome as well as some Media Queries to emulate the game "Concentration" on a variety of devices with a nice 'Coda' styled font.
